Out of the 3 browser history, personally I think the first one is the hardest one. I am not really familiar with terms, and its not like the lab that guide me step by step, provide the code directly. The first browser history is setting up the page, everything from scratch, step by step to build up the website. In browser history 1, the most challenging part is include a list of table of content, trying to remember the code, and setting up the format. Another challenge part is to meet the Rx time, my first try is DNF, then couple days later I did it again, totally forgot how to do it ended up 23 minutes. It improved compare to my first try, but I am not satisfied with my time, I tried a third time.  Since I already set up the page in browser history 1, the second part is not that complicated, but then I still need to watch the screencast to figured it out how to do, the most challenge part is to remember the code    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Oswald|Open+Sans" to link it to style.css so my page look colorful and organize. I would say this Is the most easy work out out of the three. Lastly, the third one wasn’t too bad, adding some style on style.css. But I have some difficulty, my page is not in column as the example shown, but then watching the screencast, I found that <div class “ left”></div> should not be in one line, I should put  <div class “ left”> before the heading and </div> at the end of the paragraph. Overall, with the lab 1 and 2 knowledge in mind, browser history is more like an extra practice to get more use to styling and formatting the page with different code.
